# Practical exercise 1

In this practical exercise you will:

-   Access ARCHER2, or Cirrus, or a Machine of your choice using SSH.
-   Become familiar with linux and the command line.
-   Compile and run serial code interactively.
-   Submit serial and parallel programs to run using the batch system.

The case study code for this exercise is a image sharpening program. The source code we will use is on this Github repo: [https://github.com/sfarr-epcc/sharpen](https://github.com/sfarr-epcc/sharpen)


The exercise is split into a few parts that should be done in order:  

  - [Theory of the case study program](./theory.md)   
  - [Part 1](./part1.md) - Connecting to a HPC machine with SSH
  - [Part 2](./part2.md) - Compilation and running
  - [Part 3](./part3.md) - Job submission
