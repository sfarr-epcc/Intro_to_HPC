# Practical exercise 1

In this practical exercise you will:

-   Access ARCHER2, or Cirrus, or a Machine of your choice using SSH.
-   Become familiar with linux and the command line.
-   Compile and run serial code interactively.
-   Submit serial and parallel programs to run using the batch system.

The case study code for this exercise is a image sharpening program. The source code we will use is on this Github repo: [https://github.com/sfarr-epcc/image_sharpening](https://github.com/sfarr-epcc/image_sharpening)


The exercise is split into a few parts that should be done in order:  

  - [Optional: Theory of the case-study program](./theory.md)   
  - [Part 1: Connecting to a HPC machine with SSH](./part1.md)   
  - [Part 2: Linux, command line, compilation]  
  - [Part 3: Job submission]
