In this exercise you will:
- compile and run difference version of the same code: Serial, OpenMP,MPI, C, Fortran, Python
- Perform benchmarking of the code, investigating the strong scaling, the weak scaling, and serial performance of the different languages and parallelisation techniques


The case study code for this exercise is a 2D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code. The content is all contained in this seperate webpage:
